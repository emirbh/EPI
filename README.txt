I do not knopw:
- ARRAYS (a lot of things I do not know: k-sum, 0 mod n, permutations,)
- LINKED LISTS (postings list)
- STACKS, QUEUES (time/value maximum interval - no idea what is this about)
- BINARY TREE (reconstruct tree from pre/i/post-order)
- SORTING (two arrays k-th element, root, sorting like 11.4 ...)

i- STACKS (postings list)
MEDIANs ?
